            Hello! My name is Moises Gomez I am from New York City. I enjoy
            building websites and strenghten my skills. I first fell in love
            with coding when I took an intro course to computer science. I would
            stay after class with the professor to learn how he created
            websites. I thought it was impressive how he got websites to work.
            Thats when I decided to become a software engineer.
